# Intelligent Architecture Search System

## Overview

A sophisticated search and query system that enables AI coding agents and developers to easily access architectural knowledge from the project knowledge graph. This system provides context-aware responses about system architecture, component relationships, and design decisions to eliminate "blind coding" and accelerate development.

## Problem Statement

**Current Pain Points:**
- AI coding agents make architectural decisions without understanding existing patterns
- Developers spend 40% longer resolving issues due to missing system context
- New team members take months to understand system architecture
- Architectural knowledge is scattered across docs, code, and tribal knowledge
- Repeated architectural questions waste engineering time

**Impact:**
- AI agents code blindly, creating inconsistent patterns
- Context switching penalties cost 23% of development time
- Knowledge silos prevent effective collaboration
- Technical debt accumulates from uninformed architectural choices

## Vision

Create an **intelligent architectural oracle** that:
- Provides instant context to AI coding agents about existing architecture
- Enables natural language queries about system design and component relationships
- Delivers proactive architectural guidance during development
- Builds institutional knowledge that scales with team growth

## Core Components

### 3. Proactive Architecture Assistant
**Purpose**: Provide intelligent architectural guidance during development

**Capabilities:**

- Warn about potential architectural violations or inconsistencies
- Recommend relevant precedents and decision rationale
- Guide new developers through architectural understanding

**Implementation:**
- Integration with existing MCP tools for real-time assistance

### 4. Developer Experience Interface
**Purpose**: Make architectural knowledge accessible through intuitive interfaces

**Capabilities:**
- Claude Code integration for instant architectural context
- CLI commands for quick architectural queries
- Web interface for visual exploration of system architecture
- Team collaboration features for architectural discussions

**Implementation:**
- Enhanced MCP tools specifically for architectural queries

## Technical Implementation Details

### Architectural Entity Schema
```typescript
interface ArchitecturalEntity {
  id: string;
  type: 'system' | 'container' | 'component' | 'interface' | 'data_model';
  c4_layer: 'context' | 'container' | 'component' | 'code';
  name: string;
  description: string;
  technologies: string[];
  responsibilities: string[];
  relationships: ArchitecturalRelationship[];
  decisions: ArchitectureDecision[];
  lastUpdated: Date;
}

interface ArchitecturalRelationship {
  type: 'depends_on' | 'communicates_with' | 'implements' | 'extends';
  target: string;
  strength: number;
  context: string;
}
```

### Query Processing Pipeline
```typescript
interface ArchitecturalQuery {
  question: string;
  context?: {
    currentFile?: string;
    projectArea?: string;
    userRole?: 'developer' | 'architect' | 'manager';
  };
  scope?: 'current_component' | 'current_service' | 'entire_system';
  includeHistory?: boolean;
}

interface ArchitecturalResponse {
  answer: string;
  relevantEntities: ArchitecturalEntity[];
  relatedDecisions: ArchitectureDecision[];
  suggestedActions: string[];
  confidence: number;
  sources: DocumentReference[];
}
```

### MCP Tool Specifications
```typescript
// New specialized architectural query tools
const architecturalTools = [
  'query_architecture',           // Natural language architectural queries
  'find_component_relationships', // Component dependency analysis  
  'get_architectural_context',    // Current development context
  'suggest_architectural_patterns', // Pattern recommendations
  'validate_architectural_decision', // Decision impact analysis
  'explore_architectural_history'   // Evolution and decision tracking

const context = await queryArchitecture({
  question: "How should I implement user authentication in this system?",
  context: { currentFile: "src/auth/login.ts" }
});

// Response includes:
// - Existing authentication patterns
// - Security decisions and rationale  
// - Related components and dependencies
// - Recommended implementation approach
```

### **Scenario 2: Developer Onboarding**
```bash
# New team member exploring system architecture
deno task architecture --query "What are the main services and how do they communicate?"

# Interactive exploration
deno task architecture --explore --component "UserService"
deno task architecture --decisions --area "authentication"
```

### **Scenario 3: Architectural Decision Support**
```typescript
// Before making architectural change
const impact = await validateArchitecturalDecision({
  proposal: "Extract notification logic into separate microservice",
  currentContext: "monolithic architecture"
});

// Response includes:
// - Impact analysis on existing components
// - Similar decisions and their outcomes
// - Implementation considerations
