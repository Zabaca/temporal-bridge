# Automated Architecture Documentation System

## Overview

A system that monitors git commits to identify architectural changes and automatically generates, updates, or suggests documentation based on code structure changes. All changes are stored in the project knowledge graph for intelligent querying and cross-referencing.

## Problem Statement

**Current Pain Points:**
- Architecture documentation becomes stale immediately after code changes
- Developers forget to update docs when making structural changes  
- New team members struggle to understand system architecture
- AI coding agents make architectural decisions without understanding existing patterns
- Documentation debt accumulates, leading to the $650B knowledge crisis

**Impact:**
- 40% longer incident resolution due to missing system context
- 3-6 months for new developers to become productive vs. weeks
- 21% developer time lost to poor documentation
- AI agents code blindly without architectural awareness

## Vision

Transform architecture documentation from a **manual maintenance burden** into an **automated, intelligent system** that:
- Detects architectural changes automatically through git analysis
- Generates and updates documentation proactively
- Builds searchable knowledge graphs of system evolution
- Provides context-aware insights to AI coding agents

## Core Components

### 1. Git Change Analysis Engine
**Purpose**: Monitor commits and identify architectural changes

**Capabilities:**
- Parse git diffs to detect structural changes
- Identify new components, services, databases, APIs
- Detect refactoring patterns and component relationships
- Classify change types (new feature, refactor, dependency update)

**Implementation:**
- Git hooks integration for real-time monitoring
- Batch analysis for historical commits
- AST parsing for language-specific architectural patterns
- Pattern matching for common architectural changes

### 2. Documentation Generation Pipeline
**Purpose**: Create and update architecture documentation automatically

**Capabilities:**
- Generate C4 diagrams from code structure analysis  
- Create/update ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)
- Produce component documentation and API references
- Generate system dependency maps and data flow diagrams

**Implementation:**
- Template-based documentation generation
- Mermaid diagram generation for visual architecture
- Structured frontmatter for Zep knowledge graph ingestion
- Version-controlled documentation with change tracking

### 3. Knowledge Graph Integration
**Purpose**: Store architectural knowledge in searchable format

**Capabilities:**
- Ingest generated documentation into project knowledge graph
- Create relationships between components, decisions, and changes
- Track architectural evolution over time
- Enable semantic search across architectural concepts

**Implementation:**
- Automatic documentation ingestion via existing `ingest_documentation` tool
- Enhanced entity types for architectural components
- Relationship tracking for component dependencies
- Temporal knowledge preservation

### 4. Change Notification System
**Purpose**: Alert developers to documentation needs and updates

**Capabilities:**
- Suggest documentation updates based on code changes
- Notify teams of architectural modifications
- Create GitHub issues/PRs for documentation updates
- Integration with existing development workflows

**Implementation:**
- Configurable notification rules and thresholds
- Integration with GitHub/GitLab webhook systems
- Email/Slack notifications for significant changes
- PR automation for documentation updates

## Technical Implementation Details

### Git Analysis Pipeline
```typescript
interface ArchitecturalChange {
  type: 'component' | 'service' | 'database' | 'api' | 'dependency';
  action: 'added' | 'modified' | 'removed' | 'refactored';
  files: string[];
  impact: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  suggestedDocumentation: DocumentationSuggestion[];
}

interface DocumentationSuggestion {
  type: 'c4-diagram' | 'adr' | 'component-doc' | 'api-reference';
  template: string;
  autoGenerate: boolean;
  reviewRequired: boolean;
}
```

### Documentation Templates
```yaml
# C4 Level 2 Container Template
---
entity_type: Architecture
c4_layer: container
technology_stack: "{{ detected_technologies }}"
components:
{{#each components}}
  - {{ name }}
{{/each}}
---

## {{ system_name }} Container Architecture

{{ auto_generated_description }}

### Detected Components
{{#each components}}
- **{{ name }}**: {{ description }}
{{/each}}
```

## Success Metrics
